* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or equivalent)
* [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) (optional, for deployment)

## Usage

To build and run this project, please follow these steps:

* [Clone or download](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) this repository
* Open a shell (command prompt or terminal should work just fine)
* `cd` into the directory you downloaded the project into
* `npm install` to install NodeJS dependencies
* `npm start` to begin running the service
* Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the test frontend, or use a tool like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to directly issue requests against the API.
